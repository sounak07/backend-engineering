# HTTP 1.0 -> HTTP 1.1 -> HTTP 2.0 -> HTTP 3.0 (QUIC).

## HTTP 1.0

HTTP 1.0 was finalized and fully documented in 1996. Every request to the same server requires a separate TCP connection.

## HTTP 1.1

HTTP 1.1 was published in 1997. A TCP connection can be left open for reuse (persistent connection), but it doesnâ€™t solve the `HOL` (head-of-line) blocking issue.

> HOL blocking - when the number of allowed 
parallel requests in the browser is used up, subsequent requests need to wait for the former ones to complete.

## HTTP 2.0

HTTP 2.0 was published in 2015. It addresses HOL issue through request multiplexing, which eliminates HOL blocking at the application layer, but HOL still exists at the transport (TCP) layer.

## HTTP 3.0

HTTP 3.0 first draft was published in 2020. It is the proposed successor to HTTP 2.0. It uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol, thus removing HOL blocking in the transport layer.

## HTTPS

- Any message encrypted with Bob's public can only be decrypted by Bob's private key.
- Anyone with access to Alice's public key can verify that this message could have been only generated by Alice's private key
