- **Seasonal highlights**:
    
    - Cherry blossoms in **spring**
        
    - Autumn foliage in **fall**
        
    - Events/festivals in **summer** or **winter** (less crowded, easier on the budget).
        
- **Food-friendly notes**: Vegetarian and vegan picks are scattered throughout (e.g., T’s TanTan, Kamaya, Takinoya, Takinoya, Mizuya Chaya)—plenty of tasty options.
